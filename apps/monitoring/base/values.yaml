    ## scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.
    ## AdditionalScrapeConfigs can be defined as a list or as a templated string.
    ##
    ## The scrape configuration example below will find master nodes, provided they have the name .*mst.*, relabel the
    ## port to 2379 and allow etcd scraping provided it is running on all Kubernetes master nodes

    ## If scrape config contains a repetitive section, you may want to use a template.
